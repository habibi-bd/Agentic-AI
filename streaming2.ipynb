      "// This is your class definition. The class name should match the file name (HelloWorld.java)\n",
      "public class HelloWorld {\n",
      "\n",
      "    // This is the main method, the entry point for your Java application.\n",
      "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
      "\n",
      "        // This line prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console and then moves to a new line.\n",
      "        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Let's break down each part:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **`public class HelloWorld { ... }`**\n",
      "    *   **`public`**: An access modifier, meaning this class can be accessed from anywhere.\n",
      "    *   **`class`**: A keyword used to declare a class. In Java, all code resides within classes.\n",
      "    *   **`HelloWorld`**: The name of your class. By convention, class names start with an uppercase letter and follow PascalCase. **Important:** When you save this file, its name *must* be `HelloWorld.java` to match the class name.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **`public static void main(String[] args) { ... }`**\n",
      "    *   This is the **main method**, which is the entry point for any standalone Java application. When you run a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for this specific method to start execution.\n",
      "    *   **`public`**: Again, an access modifier, meaning this method can be called from anywhere (specifically, by the JVM).\n",
      "    *   **`static`**: This keyword means the `main` method belongs to the `HelloWorld` class itself, rather than to an instance (object) of `HelloWorld`. The JVM can call it directly without creating an object.\n",
      "    *   **`void`**: This indicates that the `main` method does not return any value.\n",
      "    *   **`main`**: The name of the method. This name is fixed for the program's entry point.\n",
      "    *   **`(String[] args)`**: This declares a parameter for the `main` method: an array of `String` objects named `args`. This allows you to pass command-line arguments to your Java program when you run it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **`System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");`**\n",
      "    *   This is the core line that performs the printing.\n",
      "    *   **`System`**: A final class in the `java.lang` package that provides access to system resources.\n",
      "    *   **`.out`**: A static member of the `System` class, which is an instance of `PrintStream`. This `PrintStream` object is typically connected to the console (standard output).\n",
      "    *   **`.println()`**: A method of the `PrintStream` class. It stands for \"print line.\" It takes a string (or other data types) as an argument, prints it to the console, and then moves the cursor to the next line.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Compile and Run (using a command prompt/terminal):\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Save the code:** Open a plain text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or any IDE) and paste the code. Save the file as `HelloWorld.java` in a directory of your choice (e.g., `C:\\JavaPrograms` on Windows or `~/java_programs` on macOS/Linux).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Open your terminal/command prompt:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Windows:** Search for \"Command Prompt\" or \"PowerShell\".\n",
      "    *   **macOS/Linux:** Open \"Terminal\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Navigate to your file's directory:** Use the `cd` (change directory) command.\n",
      "    ```bash\n",
      "    cd C:\\JavaPrograms  # On Windows\n",
      "    # OR\n",
      "    cd ~/java_programs # On macOS/Linux\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Compile the code:** Use the Java compiler (`javac`).\n",
      "    ```bash\n",
      "    javac HelloWorld.java\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "    If there are no errors, this command will create a file named `HelloWorld.class` in the same directory. This is the bytecode that the JVM understands.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Run the code:** Use the Java Virtual Machine (`java`).\n",
      "    ```bash\n",
      "    java HelloWorld\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "    **Note:** You run the class name (`HelloWorld`), not the `.class` file name.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Expected Output:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Hello, World!\n",
      "```\n",

It helps you understand the basic structure of a Java program and how to get output.\\n\\nHere\\'s how you do it, step-by-step:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. The Java Code\\n\\nFirst, you need to write the code. Open a simple text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or any code editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).\\n\\n```java\\n// HelloWorld.java\\npublic class HelloWorld {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Save this file as `HelloWorld.java`** (the file name must exactly match the class name, including capitalization, and end with `.java`).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Understanding the Code\\n\\nLet\\'s break down what each part of this code means:\\n\\n*   `// HelloWorld.java`: This is a single-line comment. It\\'s ignored by the compiler and is just for humans to read.\\n*   `public class HelloWorld`:\\n    *   `public`: This is an access modifier, meaning this class can be accessed from anywhere.\\n    *   `class`: This keyword declares a class. In Java, all code resides within classes.\\n    *   `HelloWorld`: This is the name of our class. It\\'s a convention to start class names with an uppercase letter.\\n*   `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the **main method**, which is the entry point of any Java application. When you run a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for and executes this method first.\\n    *   `public`: Again, an access modifier, meaning this method can be called from anywhere.\\n    *   `static`: This means the method belongs to the `HelloWorld` class itself, rather than to an instance (object) of the class. You can call it directly using the class name (`HelloWorld.main(...)`).\\n    *   `void`: This indicates that the `main` method does not return any value.\\n    *   `main`: This is the name of the method. It *must* be `main` for the JVM to recognize it as the entry point.\\n    *   `(String[] args)`: This defines the parameters the `main` method accepts. `args` is an array of `String` objects, which can be used to pass command-line arguments to your program.\\n*   `System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");`: This is the line that actually prints the message.\\n    *   `System`: This is a built-in Java class that provides access to system resources.\\n    *   `out`: This is a `static` member of the `System` class, and it\\'s an instance of `PrintStream`. It represents the standard output stream (usually your console).\\n    *   `println()`: This is a method of the `PrintStream` class. It prints the given argument to the console and then moves the cursor to the next line (prints a \"line\" break). If you used `print()` instead, it would print without a new line.\\n    *   `\"Hello, World!\"`: This is a string literal, the actual text we want to print.\\n    *   `;`: Every statement in Java must end with a semicolon.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Compiling and Running from the Command Line\\n\\nTo run this program, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.\\n\\n1.  **Open your command prompt or terminal.**\\n2.  **Navigate to the directory where you saved `HelloWorld.java`.**\\n    *   For example, if you saved it in `C:\\\\MyJavaPrograms`, you would type:\\n        ```bash\\n        cd C:\\\\MyJavaPrograms\\n        ```\\n    *   On macOS/Linux, if you saved it in `~/Documents/Java`, you would type:\\n        ```bash\\n        cd ~/Documents/Java\\n        ```\\n3.  **Compile the Java code:**\\n    ```bash\\n    javac HelloWorld.java\\n    ```\\n    *   If there are no errors, this command will create a file named `HelloWorld.class` in the same directory. This `.class` file contains the bytecode that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can understand.\\n4.  **Run the compiled Java program:**\\n    ```bash\\n    java HelloWorld\\n    ```\\n    *   **Important:** Notice you don\\'t include the `.class` extension here.\\n    *   This command tells the JVM to load and execute the `HelloWorld.class` file.\\n\\nYou should see the following output in your console:\\n\\n```\\nHello, World!\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\\n\\nFor more complex projects, or just for an easier development experience, most Java developers use an IDE. Popular choices include:\\n\\n*   **IntelliJ IDEA** (Community Edition is free)\\n*   **Eclipse**\\n*   **VS Code** (with Java extensions)\\n\\nHere\\'s a general idea of how it works in an IDE:\\n\\n1.  **Create a new Java Project:** Most IDEs have a \"New Project\" wizard.\\n2.  **Create a new Java Class:** Inside your project, create a new class and name it `HelloWorld`. The IDE will automatically generate the basic class structure for you.\\n3.  **Paste the code:** Copy and paste the `System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");` line inside the `main` method.\\n4.  **Run the program:** IDEs usually have a \"Run\" button (often a green triangle) or a \"Run\" menu option.
